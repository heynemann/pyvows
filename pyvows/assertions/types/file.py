'''PyVows file assertions.  For use with `expect()` (see `pyvows.core`).

For these assertions, "file" can be either a string or a file object.  Since
a string is required to create a file object in the first place, these
assertions provide a convenient, flexible way to test whether a topic is
a "file" in your vows.
