'''PyVows is a Behavior-Driven Development framework for Python.  (And and it
is **fast**!)

---

PyVows runs tests asynchronously.  This makes tests which target I/O
run much faster, by running them concurrently. A faster test suite gets
run more often, thus improving the feedback cycle.

PyVows is inspired by Vows, a BDD framework for Node.js.

----

You typically shouldn't need to import any specific modules from the `pyvows`
package.  Normal use is:

    from pyvows import Vows, expect
