'''PyVows is a test engine based on Vows.js. It features topic-based testing,
(fast!) parallel running of tests, code coverage reports, test profiling, and
more.

PyVows is inspired by Vows.js, a BDD framework for Node.js.

---

PyVows runs tests asynchronously.  This makes tests which target I/O run much 
faster, by executing them concurrently. 

A faster test suite gets run more often, thus improving the feedback cycle.
